## Prerequisites

[Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/)

Please create a new file `.env.development` and put this env variable with your GitHub token

> If you're building locally, you will have to create a new file `.env.production` and put the same env variable

```bash
GITHUB_TOKEN=xxxxxxxxxx
```

Don't forget to edit your site's data on `data/config.js` file with your Google Recaptcha public key

When deploying on Netlify, you will have to set the private key as well

```bash
SITE_RECAPTCHA_KEY=xxxxx

SITE_RECAPTCHA_SECRET=xxxxx
```

I highly recommend you check this [repository](https://github.com/imorente/gatsby-netlify-form-example) for more details about the Google Recaptcha and Netlify forms
